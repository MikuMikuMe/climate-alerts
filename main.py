Creating a comprehensive real-time notification system for climate-related risks involves multiple components, such as data aggregation from reliable sources, machine learning for forecasting, and a notification system. Below is a simplified, modular, and error-handling-focused version of such a system. This example assumes you have access to some mock data APIs for climate data and libraries for machine learning and notifications.

Ensure you have necessary libraries installed, for example:

```bash
pip install requests sklearn
```

Here's a Python program demonstrating this concept:

```python
import requests
import json
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import numpy as np

# Constants
API_ENDPOINT = "https://api.mockclimate.com/v1/getdata"  # Replace with a real climate data API
NOTIFICATION_ENDPOINT = "https://api.mocknotifications.com/send"  # Replace with a real notification service endpoint

# Dummy data, to be replaced by real API data fetching
def fetch_climate_data(location):
    """Fetch climate-related data for a given location."""
    try:
        response = requests.get(API_ENDPOINT, params={"location": location})
        response.raise_for_status()
        data = response.json()
        return data
    except requests.exceptions.HTTPError as http_err:
        print(f"HTTP error occurred: {http_err}")
    except Exception as err:
        print(f"Other error occurred: {err}")
    return None

def process_data(raw_data):
    """Process raw data and prepare it for machine learning."""
    # Example processing; this needs to be customized to your data structure
    try:
        # Assuming raw_data is a dictionary with keys 'date' and 'risk_factor'
        dates = []
        risk_factors = []
        for entry in raw_data:
            dates.append(entry['date'])  # Replace with appropriate fields
            risk_factors.append(entry['risk_factor'])
        return np.array(dates), np.array(risk_factors)
    except KeyError as e:
        print(f"Missing expected data field: {e}")
    except Exception as err:
        print(f"Error processing data: {err}")
    return None, None

def train_model(dates, risk_factors):
    """Train a machine learning model for forecasting."""
    try:
        # Simple linear regression model
        model = LinearRegression()
        # Reshaping data as sklearn expects 2D arrays
        X = np.arange(len(dates)).reshape(-1, 1)
        y = risk_factors
        model.fit(X, y)
        return model
    except Exception as err:
        print(f"Error during model training: {err}")
    return None

def send_notification(location, forecast):
    """Send a notification with the forecasted risk."""
    try:
        message = f"Climate alert for {location}: Forecasted risk is {forecast}"
        response = requests.post(NOTIFICATION_ENDPOINT, json={"message": message})
        response.raise_for_status()
        print("Notification sent successfully!")
    except requests.exceptions.HTTPError as http_err:
        print(f"HTTP error during notification: {http_err}")
    except Exception as err:
        print(f"Other error occurred during notification: {err}")

def main():
    location = "New York"  # Example location, could be input from the user
    print(f"Fetching climate data for {location}...")
    raw_data = fetch_climate_data(location)

    if raw_data:
        print("Processing data...")
        dates, risk_factors = process_data(raw_data)

        if dates is not None and risk_factors is not None:
            print("Training model...")
            model = train_model(dates, risk_factors)

            if model:
                # Predicting the next risk factor
                next_date = np.array([[len(dates)]])
                forecast = model.predict(next_date)[0]
                print(f"Forecasted risk for next date: {forecast}")

                print("Sending notification...")
                send_notification(location, forecast)
            else:
                print("Model training failed.")
        else:
            print("Data processing failed.")
    else:
        print("Failed to fetch climate data.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Key Points:
- **Data Fetching**: Using a placeholder API to illustrate how you'd fetch data.
- **Error Handling**: Extensive error handling with `try-except` blocks for network requests and data processing errors.
- **Machine Learning**: A basic linear regression model is used to predict the risk factor.
- **Notifications**: Illustrative method to send alerts, replace with actual notification service.
- **Flexibility**: Modular functions allow for easier updates, substitutions with real services, and expansions.

### Note:
- Replace placeholder URLs with actual services you can use.
- This example is a simplification. A real system would need robust data cleaning, possibly more complex models (especially for time series), and more sophisticated notification logistics.
